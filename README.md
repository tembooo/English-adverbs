### tip1:

| **Sentence**           | **Meaning**                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Come here!             | Come towards me.                          |

| Put it there.          | Put it in a place away from me.           |
| The table is in there. | Go in; you can see it by yourself.        |

### tip2:

Point:

Here and there are placed at the beginning of a sentence in exclamations or when emphasis is needed.

They are followed by the verb if the subject is a noun, or by a pronoun if the subject is a pronoun.

Examples:

Here comes the bus!

There it is!

Here they are!


### tip3: Adverbs of Place That Are Also Prepositions

When these are used as prepositions, they must be followed by a noun.

| **Word** | **Used as an adverb of place (modifying a verb)** | **Used as a preposition**                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| around   | The marble rolled around in my hand.              | I am wearing a necklace around my neck.      |
| behind   | Hurry! You are getting behind.                    | Let’s hide behind the shed.                  |
| down     | Mary fell down.                                   | John made his way carefully down the cliff.  |

| over     | He turned over and went back to sleep.            | I think I will hang the picture over my bed. |

### tip4: Adverbs of Place Ending in “-where”
These adverbs express a general location without specifying direction or place.

Examples:

I would like to go somewhere warm for my vacation.

Is there anywhere I can find a perfect plate of spaghetti around here?

I have nowhere to go.

I keep running into Sally everywhere!


# 4. Adverbs of Certainty
Adverbs of Certainty show **how certain** we are about something.

Obviously – Obviously, we don’t want to spend too much money.  
Presumably – Presumably, this is where the accident happened.  
Probably – She will probably come.  
Certainly – It will certainly rain this evening.

### tip1: Word Order Rule

**Point:**

Adverbs of certainty usually go in **mid-position**.  
They are placed:
- **after auxiliary verbs**
- **before other verbs**

When there are two or more auxiliaries, the adverb goes **after the first**.

### tip2: Exceptions

**Perhaps** and **may be** are exceptions to this rule.  
They usually go at the **beginning of a clause**.

Examples:
- Perhaps she will come.  
- May be you are right.


# 5. Adverbs of Degree
Adverbs of Degree answer **"how much"** or **"to what extent"**.  
They usually modify **verbs, adjectives, or adverbs**, making them stronger or weaker.

# 6. Adverbs of Attitude
We use **evaluative adverbs** to make our **attitude about something clear**.

Common examples include:  
*frankly, fortunately, honestly, hopefully, interestingly, luckily, sadly, seriously, surprisingly, unbelievably*, etc.

Frankly – Frankly, I don’t think we’ll win.

Hopefully – Hopefully, he will reach the top.

### tip: Dual Function

- He wants to speak to her *frankly*.
