* **Week, Month, Year, Season, Decade**
* Days: *Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday*, etc.

* Seasons: *Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer*
* Use with **next** / **last** to create expressions like:

Examples:

* I’ll see you **next week**.
* She graduated **last year**.
* We always travel **in summer**.

# 3. Adverbs of Manner

**Important point:**

He speaks quickly.

### tip1: Linking Verbs & Adjective Usage

Action verbs and linking verbs:

* Action: He walks slowly (*adverb*)
* Linking: He looks good (*adjective*)

**Linking verb list:** be, seem, become, look, sound, smell, taste, feel

| **Verb** | **Example sentence**           |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| be       | He **is horrible**.            |
| seem     | She **seems nice**.            |
| become   | It **became dark**.            |
| look     | She **looks good**.            |

| smell    | The roses **smell beautiful**. |
| taste    | This sauce **tastes awful**!   |
| feel     | I **feel weak** today.         |

### tip2: Adjectives with -ly

* costly, cowardly, deadly, friendly, likely, lively, lonely, lovely, silly, ugly, unlikely

### tip3: Words That Are Both Adjectives and Adverbs

* Examples: fast, hard, high, late, near, straight, wrong, daily, early
* He drove **fast** (*adverb*)
* A **fast** (*adjective*) car goes **fast** (*adverb*)

# 4. Adverbs of Place

Adverbs of Place describe **"where"** an action takes place. They come **after** the verb.

* Everywhere – I searched everywhere I could think of.
* Back – I'm going back to school.
* In – Come in!
* Nearby – They built a house nearby.
* Outside – She took the child outside.
* Down – When she entered the classroom, she sat down.
* Downstairs – He walks downstairs to meet his father.

### tip1:

| **Sentence**           | **Meaning**                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Come here!             | Come towards me.                          |
| The table is in here.  | Come with me; we will go see it together. |
| Put it there.          | Put it in a place away from me.           |
| The table is in there. | Go in; you can see it by yourself.        |

### tip2:

**Point:**
Here and there are placed at the beginning of a sentence in exclamations or when emphasis is needed. They are followed by the verb if the subject is a noun, or by a pronoun if the subject is a pronoun.

**Examples:**

* Here comes the bus!
* There it is!
* Here they are!

### tip3: Adverbs of Place That Are Also Prepositions

When used as prepositions, they must be followed by a noun.

| **Word** | **Used as adverb**              | **Used as preposition**                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| around   | The marble rolled around.       | I am wearing a necklace around my neck. |
| behind   | You are getting behind.         | Let’s hide behind the shed.             |
| down     | Mary fell down.                 | He walked down the cliff.               |
| in       | We dropped in on Jake.          | The letter is in the mailbox.           |
| off      | Let’s get off at the next stop. | The flowers blew off the tree.          |
| on       | We rode on for hours.           | Put the books on the table.             |
| over     | He turned over and slept.       | I hung the picture over the bed.        |

### tip4: Adverbs of Place Ending in -where

These express a general location without specifying direction.

**Examples:**

* I would like to go **somewhere** warm.
* Is there **anywhere** to eat around here?
* I have **nowhere** to go.
* I keep seeing her **everywhere**.

* Obviously – Obviously, we don’t want to overspend.
* Presumably – Presumably, this is where it happened.
* Probably – She will probably come.
* Certainly – It will certainly rain tonight.

### tip1: Word Order Rule

Adverbs of certainty usually go in **mid-position**:

* after auxiliary verbs
* before other verbs

If there are multiple auxiliaries, the adverb comes **after the first**.

### tip2: Exceptions

**Perhaps** and **may be** are exceptions.
They usually appear **at the beginning of a clause**.

**Examples:**

* Perhaps she will come.
* May be you are right.
